Instances of std::function can store, copy, and invoke any Callable target \u2013 functions, lambda expressions, bind expressions, or other function objects, as well as pointers to member functions and pointers to data members. The stored callable object is called the target of std::function. If a std::function contains no target, it is called empty. Invoking the target of an empty std::function results in std::bad_function_call exception being thrown. std::function satisfies the requirements of CopyConstructible and CopyAssignable. Therefore, the effect of std::function can be summarized as follows. std::function encapsulates various callable entities in C++ to form a new callable std::function object; std::function objects are type-safe wraps around existing callable entities in C++ (callable entities such as function pointers are type-unsafe). You just need to convert the function to a specific function type when you call it. std::function <void()> a = static_cast<fun_ptr_a>(print); std::function <void(int)> b = static_cast<fun_ptr_b>(print); std::bind Summary The bind function can be viewed as a generic function adapter, so called an adapter, even if one thing behaves like a mechanism for another, such as a container adapter: stack , queue , priority_queue . The bind function takes a callable and generates a new callable to fit the original object. The function prototype template <class Fn, class... Args> /* unspecified */ bind (Fn&& fn, Args&&... args); The bind function takes a comma-separated list of arguments args for the given function object fn and returns a new function object. Parameters in the list args . If bound to a value, the function object returned by the call will always take that value as an argument; If is a placeholder like _n , the function object returned by the call forwards the argument passed to the call (the sequence number of the argument is specified by the placeholder). Usage std::bind is commonly used with std::function , and the return value of std::bind can be stored directly through std::function . CallBack Implementation Define a callback function; The party providing the implementation of the function registers the function pointer of the callback function to callers at the time of initialization; When a specific event or a condition occurs, the caller uses the function pointer to call the callback function to process the event. Advantages Because you can use this function to separate the caller from the callee, the caller doesn't care who the callee is. It just needs to know that there is a called function with a specific stereotype and restrictions. In short, a callback function allows a user to pass a pointer to a function that needs to be called as an argument, so that the function has the flexibility to use different methods when handling similar events. virtual In the absence of virtual , the compiler does not know much more than the base class when called with a pointer to the base class, and usually calls the base class version of the function; When a function is declared with virtual , the compiler creates a VTABLE whenever a class containing or derived from a class containing a virtual function is created; If the derived class does not redefine the virtual function of the base class, the address of the virtual function of the base class is filled in VTABLE . The compiler places a VPTR in the class that points to the corresponding VTABLE . The initialization of VPTR is done in the constructor. All the virtual functions of the parent class will be summarized into a table, and the subclass will allocate a block of memory to store the table and a pointer which points to the table. If any function is overloaded, it will overwrite the address of that function in the table. The reason why the destructor of the superclass must be virtual is to prevent running out of memory when you delete subclasses. std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr std::unique_ptr std::unique_ptr allows only one pointer to the same object, so the object will be destroyed automatically when the pointer is destroyed. You can change the ownership by std::move . The make_unique is recommended to create std::unique_ptr which can reduce code duplication. std::shared_ptr std::shared_ptr allows multiple Pointers to the same object with an internal counter to record the number of Pointers. You can also change ownership by std::move . The make_shared is recommended to create std::shared_ptr which can reduce code duplication. VSync Vertical synchronization aims to solve the problem that the FPS of screens and display frames are not in sync. When there are gaps, there may be Screen tearing , as shown in the following image. The graphic below shows the situation when the GPU and the display draw frame rate are out of sync. Advantages Reduce the frame rate of the GPU to match the frame rate of the monitor For some older games, the GPU frame rate will be particularly high, which is very performance consuming, and enabling Vsync will synchronize the GPU frame rate to the display frame rate, thus reducing the computation of GPU . Disadvantages Input latency may be experienced through the mouse and keyboard (commonly known as not following your hands). The interval input keyboard shown below is delayed until the next frame.

Developers can use game engines to construct games for video game consoles and other types of computers. The core functionality typically provided by a game engine may include a rendering engine (\"renderer\") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and video support for cinematics.

Game engine Framework From top to bottom, they are the tools layer, the function layer, the resource layer, the platform layer and the core layer, with third-party libraries. I place the platform layer above the core layer, which means to abstract API from core codes to the platform layer and override them. Tools layer Provide developers with editor tools, such as blueprints. Function layer It is mainly through the underlying core modules to achieve the main functions required by engine development, and Tick each function module in order. Schedule and management among multithreads also belong to this layer. Resource layer It is used to record the reference relationships within or between resources and also manage the asset lifecycle. For example, when Assimp load models, a storage structure like the following will be built. Platform layer It will override the API from the core layer by different methods which depend on game platforms and rendering interfaces. Core layer Includes math library, event monitoring, logging and other core functions. Data structure and memory management also belong to this layer, by optimizing the underlying data storage to reduce memory holes.
